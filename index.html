Style guide to contributors:
============================
- this document uses ReSpec, see
  http://dev.w3.org/2009/dap/ReSpec.js/documentation.html
- use 80 characters wide lines, whenever possible (except long links)
- keep sections 2 empty lines apart
- put comments in front of sections, for better readability with syntax coloring
  editors
- use indentation with care: it may improve readability, but at the expense of
  line lenght
- when descriptions of attributes is short, use the <dd> elements even when
  the text also contains conformance statements (e.g. MUST, SHOULD, MAY).
  No use repeating the same information in a separate paragraph.

    <p>This document captures the use cases and requirements for standardizing the technology for WoT. The use cases and requirements were gathered with consultation with Web of Things Community Group and WoT Project participants and the general public.</p>

      <p>The <code><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/">Web Architecture</a></code> is a architecture 
    	in which the items of interest, referred to as resources, are identified by global identifiers called Uniform Resource Identifiers as defined in [[!webarch]]

	   <p>The <code>WoT Gateway(or Broker)<code> is that has a role for integrating and exposing the devices to the web. This broker has responsibility for communicating between the user of the WoT (e.g., web clients, applications) and
	   fully-fledged devices as well as constrained devices as defined in [[!Y.2063]]
